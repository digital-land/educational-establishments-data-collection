# Educational establishment data

*We are using this repository as an interim fix*

This repository contains a copy of the educational-establishment dataset that we downloaded from the [Get information about a school service](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/Downloads), operated by the [Department for Education](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education).

We would like to make the data available through [planning.data.gov.uk](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/), however, our preferred approach is to make use of a persistent URL or an API to collect the data each night. This allows us to make sure the data remains up to date.

The data from Get information about a school service allows users to pick the dataset they want, then it generates a download link for them to obtain the data. This link can only be used once so we can set up the collector to collect from it each night.

As a temporary work around we have download a copy of the data and can make it available to our collector via this repository.

This will allow us to test having the data on the platform whilst we work out a longer term solution.
